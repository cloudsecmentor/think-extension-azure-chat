# think-extension-azure-chat  
Thinking extension service for [AzureChat](https://github.com/microsoft/azurechat)  

This repository presents the **Think Extension**, a service developed to enhance AzureChat by enabling asynchronous processing for complex, long-running AI tasks. Instead of modifying AzureChat itself, the Think Extension leverages its function-calling mechanisms to execute tasks asynchronously and return results once complete.

## üìñ Overview: Extending AzureChat‚Äôs Capabilities  
[AzureChat](https://github.com/microsoft/azurechat) is an accelerator for building enterprise AI applications, making it possible to deploy a fully functional corporate chatbot in under an hour. It provides enterprise-grade security, authentication, secret management, built-in user roles, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), accessibility features, and seamless tool integration.  

While AzureChat is powerful, it primarily supports **synchronous chat**. Many enterprise AI tasks‚Äîsuch as deep research‚Äîrequire **long-running, asynchronous operations**, which this Think Extension provides.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How the Think Extension Works  

The Think Extension operates as an **external service**, integrating with AzureChat via external function calls.  

1. **Asynchronous Request Handling**  
   - AzureChat forwards a complex query to the Think Extension.  
   - The Think Extension returns an immediate ID (`HTTP 202 Accepted`) acknowledging the request.  
   - AzureChat polls the service with the ID until the result is ready.  

2. **Service Structure**  
   - **API Container**: Handles incoming requests, returns IDs, forwards work to the Agent.  
   - **Agent Container**: Core intelligence. Interacts with Azure OpenAI Foundry and tools.  
   - **Tool Containers**: MCP servers for specific tasks (e.g., web search, document retrieval).  

3. **Agent‚ÄìTool Interaction**  
   - The Agent requests tools as needed, integrates their outputs, and feeds results back to the LLM.  
   - The LLM composes a final response.  

4. **Final Response Delivery**  
   - The complete answer is stored in the API container.  
   - AzureChat retrieves it by polling with the original ID.  

This separation keeps AzureChat clean while supporting scalability (e.g., multiple agents, external databases like Cosmos DB).

## üîç LLM Behavior Observations  
- **GPT-4**: Reliably shows when it uses a tool and bases answers on its output.  
- **GPT-5**: Sometimes skips tool usage but formats responses *as if* the tool was invoked. While answers may be correct, logs reveal the tool wasn‚Äôt actually called.

## üíª FastAPI Asynchronous Chatbot Interface  

This repo includes a **FastAPI app** implementing an asynchronous, polling-based chatbot interface with a mocked LLM.  

- Submits a new query ‚Üí returns a request ID immediately (`HTTP 202 Accepted`).  
- Processes in the background.  
- Poll the same endpoint with the ID to retrieve the final result.  
- If the ID is invalid or expired, returns `404 {"detail": "Invalid or expired ID"}`.
